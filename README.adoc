== Introduction

This project show different patterns to use with Java.
We have 3 main groups of patterns:

* Creational:
** Builder Pattern: https://refactorizando.com/patron-builder-java/
** Prototype Pattern: https://refactorizando.com/patron-diseno-prototype-java/
* Structural
* Behavioral
** Status Pattern: https://refactorizando.com/patron-state-patron-java/

With the idea of using the design patterns, you can make your code more flexible,
reusable and maintainable.
A good use of design pattern can accelerate the development process.

If you want more information about design, implementation etc, you can take a
